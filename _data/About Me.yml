    description:
      - Backend software engineer with a proven track record of delivering digital products in an agile environment. Leveraging an M.S. in Information Technology from Northwestern University and four years experience implementing technical solutions, I harness a strong understanding of the software development life cycle. I bring technical excellence to building and maintaining software solutions, applying the principles of object-oriented programming and best-practices of web application development. I bring leadership skills guided by honesty, vulnerability, and leading by example, both as a teammate and peer-leader, valuing the ability to influence without authority.
